      "message": "Vaisakh, I would also like to bring to your notice that if some developers end up using stock prebuilt ST NFC stack (android.hardware.nfc@1.x-service-st, where x\u003d{0,1,2}) they\u0027ll end up with denials as well. In my opinion, it would be saner to add the android.hardware.nfc@1.x-service.st alongside the older ones as well, since it\u0027d address both the HALs, although I\u0027d prefer developers to move to upstream AOSP as soon as possible.
